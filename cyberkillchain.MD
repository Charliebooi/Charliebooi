Step 1 Reconnaissance is the discovery and collection of information on victims and systems/ 
OSINT(open-source intelligence)- The collection of data that is publicly available through multiple tools and resources.

OSINT Framework
OSINT is a type of passive reconnaissance. When directly probing the target it will be considered active reconnaissance.  

Step 2 Weaponization is the process in which the exploit is weaponized. In other words is the combination of malware and the exploit into a payload. 
Malware is a program or software that is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain access to a system. 
Exploit is a flaw in an application or system.
A payload is a malicious code that an attacker runs on the system.

Step 3 Delivery is the process in which the payload is transmitted to the victim. 
Multiple methods including but not limited to
Phishing email
Infected device

Step 4 Exploitation is the actual use of the payload to gain access to the system or target. 

Step 5 Installation of a persistent backdoor that will allow the attacker access to the system. 
Installing a web shell on the server
Installing a backdoor on the victim’s machine. 
Creating or modifying Windows services.
Adding the entry to the “Run keys” for the malicious payload in the REgistry or the Startup Folder.





Step 6-Command and Control ,also known as C2, i s a type of malicious communication between a C&C server and malware on the infected host.
Infected systems will communicate constantly with the C2 server awaiting commands.
HTTP or HTTPS, with this method attackers will hide malicious code alongside legitimate traffic. 
Step 7- Actions on objective
In this phase the attacker will take action.
